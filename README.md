# Blue Collar Governance Plugin

**Status:** Early private bootstrap with a complete Wave 1 spec baseline  
**Repo type:** Private runtime/control layer  
**Implementation state:** Block A/B runtime started (`HoldEngine`, `ConstraintsRegistry`, `SafetyInterlocks`, `ScopeGuard`); Block C systems not implemented yet

## What This Repo Is

This repository is the private runtime trust layer for Blue Collar Governance Plugin. It is aimed at non-technical AI operators and builders who need explicit boundaries, dangerous-action control, unauthorized-change detection, and a durable session record without having to review source code directly.

Governed Workflow is the methodology spine behind the work. This repository is not the methodology repo. Its job is to hold the runtime trust kernel and the repo truth needed to build that kernel in a governed way.

## Current Truth

- Wave 0 bootstrap is committed.
- All six Wave 1 systems now exist as promoted contract/spec objects under `docs/specs/`.
- Wave 1 runtime has started for Block A/B (`HoldEngine`, `ConstraintsRegistry`, `SafetyInterlocks`, `ScopeGuard`); Block C systems are not implemented yet.
- No installable plugin package, runtime hook path, or compatibility layer is implemented yet.
- No skins, marketplace packaging, or public-product polish work is in scope for Wave 1.

## Wave 1 Focus

Wave 1 is limited to six systems:

- `HoldEngine`
- `ConstraintsRegistry`
- `SafetyInterlocks`
- `ScopeGuard`
- `SessionBrief`
- `SessionReceipt`

The authoritative Wave 1 scope, naming freeze, non-goals, build order, and acceptance criteria live in `docs/specs/WAVE1_TRUST_KERNEL.md`.

Promoted Wave 1 contract baselines:

- `docs/specs/HOLD_ENGINE.md`
- `docs/specs/CONSTRAINTS_REGISTRY.md`
- `docs/specs/SAFETY_INTERLOCKS.md`
- `docs/specs/SCOPE_GUARD.md`
- `docs/specs/SESSION_BRIEF.md`
- `docs/specs/SESSION_RECEIPT.md`

## Canon Vs Reference

- Canon surfaces are the root governance files and promoted specs under `docs/specs/`.
- `raw/governed-workflow/` contains imported methodology references only.
- `raw/starters/` contains starter/template inputs only.
- Reference material does not become repo truth until it is explicitly promoted into canon.

## Working In This Repo

There is no end-to-end runtime setup sequence yet. Block A/B runtime code exists for `HoldEngine`, `ConstraintsRegistry`, `SafetyInterlocks`, and `ScopeGuard`; Block C systems and compatibility surfaces are not implemented.
